# PupJump
My goal with this project was to gain a deeper understanding for how game engines work under the hood. My entire career I've devoloped games using a game engine like Unreal or Unity, but I've never really had the opportunity to fully understand how these programs worked. Decided to code a mini game using nothing but C/C++ and OpenGL.

The game is simple, survival. Dodge the balls for as long as possible until the player (my pup) is hit three times. The balls will duplicate when they collide with eachother but can only spawn once during their lifetime indicating with the red coloring. Your score will increment anytime a ball collides with the edge of the screen, try to beat the high score.
